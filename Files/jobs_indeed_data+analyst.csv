As an Etsy employee, you can do the work you love, be yourself, and make an impact in the lives of millions. Our commitments to diversity and inclusion, team culture and the spaces where we work all reflect our mission to keep commerce human.

Job Description
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.
Etsy seeks a senior product manager for the Platform Protection engineering team! This team builds user experiences, automated detection systems, and enforcement mechanisms that help our Trust & Safety team keep the platform safe from policy-violating users and content.
This is a key role in crafting, managing, and executing on Etsy’s vision and product strategy for risk detection and automated enforcement. Your focus in 2021 is to scale Trust & Safety’s detective capabilities against the fast growth Etsy is experiencing, bringing this work in line with the overall Data Science and Machine Learning technical program and reducing reliance on traditional rules-based detection.
In order to accomplish this, you’ll work cross-functionally each day with partners in engineering, design, T&S operations, research, and analytics. As an experienced Product Manager, you’ll actively contribute to solving consumer-facing problems, developing strategies and roadmaps, as well as executing those plans.
Here’s a taste of some of the problems we’re solving today:
How can we develop learning controls that are capable of sifting through large amounts of data to proactively identify items that violate Etsy policy?
How can we improve our customer-facing flagging tools that allow the Etsy community to report issues so that we collect more accurate signals about shop and item quality, and use this user-generated data to improve our automated detection?
How can we develop systems that empowers Risk Analysts and enforcement teams to spot emerging trends and quickly deploy risk interventions at scale?
About the role:
Partner closely with product leads and key business partners to refine and extend the long-term vision and product strategy for the Trust & Safety ecosystem of detective controls.
Derive insights from user and transactional data to develop machine learning model requirements in collaboration with Risk Analysts, Data Science, and Engineering.
Work collaboratively with Architecture, Product, and Engineering teams to develop and deliver products that are scalable and reliable.
Launch new high priority automated risk controls that reduce common risks across the selling and buying journey by minimizing financial loss without affecting the lifetime value, conversion rate, and engagement of “good” users.
Prioritize product features through continuous iteration, user research and analysis, and experimentation when appropriate.

Qualifications

4-6 years combined product management and risk experience with a focus on abuse and risk detection.
Experience leading technical products from inception to launch.
Excited and passionate about solving customer problems, both internal and external.
Proficiency with SQL: ability to read, edit, and write queries without assistance from data analysts.
Experience with using both qualitative and quantitative data to make product decisions. You also know when and how to balance data with intuition.
You’re capable but stay humble. You’re naturally curious and are always asking questions to better identify the problem at hand.
Committed to collaboration and clear communication: you know how to drive decision making with Ops, Engineering, Product Design, Analytics, and Research.
Great to have: Hands on experience with Trust & Safety applications of machine learning.
Nice to have: Degree in computer science.
Strong belief in Etsy’s vision, mission and values.
What's Next
If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you’ve hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don’t want you to be like everyone else — we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you’re all about.
Also point us to any online presence you may have (weblog, Twitter, Facebook, rap sheet), and if you write, draw, practice a craft, or contribute to something you’re proud of, that means a lot to us too. We would love to hear about it.

As an Etsy employee, you can do the work you love, be yourself, and make an impact in the lives of millions. Our commitments to diversity and inclusion, team culture and the spaces where we work all reflect our mission to keep commerce human.

Job Description
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.
Etsy seeks a senior product manager for the Platform Protection engineering team! This team builds user experiences, automated detection systems, and enforcement mechanisms that help our Trust & Safety team keep the platform safe from policy-violating users and content.
This is a key role in crafting, managing, and executing on Etsy’s vision and product strategy for risk detection and automated enforcement. Your focus in 2021 is to scale Trust & Safety’s detective capabilities against the fast growth Etsy is experiencing, bringing this work in line with the overall Data Science and Machine Learning technical program and reducing reliance on traditional rules-based detection.
In order to accomplish this, you’ll work cross-functionally each day with partners in engineering, design, T&S operations, research, and analytics. As an experienced Product Manager, you’ll actively contribute to solving consumer-facing problems, developing strategies and roadmaps, as well as executing those plans.
Here’s a taste of some of the problems we’re solving today:
How can we develop learning controls that are capable of sifting through large amounts of data to proactively identify items that violate Etsy policy?
How can we improve our customer-facing flagging tools that allow the Etsy community to report issues so that we collect more accurate signals about shop and item quality, and use this user-generated data to improve our automated detection?
How can we develop systems that empowers Risk Analysts and enforcement teams to spot emerging trends and quickly deploy risk interventions at scale?
About the role:
Partner closely with product leads and key business partners to refine and extend the long-term vision and product strategy for the Trust & Safety ecosystem of detective controls.
Derive insights from user and transactional data to develop machine learning model requirements in collaboration with Risk Analysts, Data Science, and Engineering.
Work collaboratively with Architecture, Product, and Engineering teams to develop and deliver products that are scalable and reliable.
Launch new high priority automated risk controls that reduce common risks across the selling and buying journey by minimizing financial loss without affecting the lifetime value, conversion rate, and engagement of “good” users.
Prioritize product features through continuous iteration, user research and analysis, and experimentation when appropriate.

Qualifications

4-6 years combined product management and risk experience with a focus on abuse and risk detection.
Experience leading technical products from inception to launch.
Excited and passionate about solving customer problems, both internal and external.
Proficiency with SQL: ability to read, edit, and write queries without assistance from data analysts.
Experience with using both qualitative and quantitative data to make product decisions. You also know when and how to balance data with intuition.
You’re capable but stay humble. You’re naturally curious and are always asking questions to better identify the problem at hand.
Committed to collaboration and clear communication: you know how to drive decision making with Ops, Engineering, Product Design, Analytics, and Research.
Great to have: Hands on experience with Trust & Safety applications of machine learning.
Nice to have: Degree in computer science.
Strong belief in Etsy’s vision, mission and values.
What's Next
If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you’ve hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don’t want you to be like everyone else — we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you’re all about.
Also point us to any online presence you may have (weblog, Twitter, Facebook, rap sheet), and if you write, draw, practice a craft, or contribute to something you’re proud of, that means a lot to us too. We would love to hear about it.
